# Credit-Risk-modelling--Zimbabwe-Data
This project applies a full data science lifecycle to credit risk modeling using 100,000 anonymized loan records from a Zimbabwean microfinance firm. After rigorous preprocessing, feature engineering, and resampling, ensemble models with hyperparameter tuning and robust evaluation deliver optimized predictions of borrower default risk.
